\section{Introduction}
Provided is a documentation of a pilot scientific cruise in the Oslofjord 21-23 September 2015. The cruise was an experiment to examine if more field test would benefit the validation of the new Oslofjord model (ref. teknisk rapport). The cruise is carried out as part of the FjordOs project.

\section{Weather conditions}

The storm "Petra" hit Buskerud, Vestfold, Telemark, and Agder from Monday 14 to Friday 18 September 2015. The storm was caused by a main low pressure in the English channel which moved northwards over the North Sea. The low pressure caused an increased water level in the Oslo fjord from the 17 to 18 September before normalizing around the 20 September (Fig.~\ref{fig:Waterlevel}).

Due to the heavy rainfall that followed, rivers and streams were flooded and caused an increased fresh water flow into the fjord. There are two large rivers connected with the Oslo fjord, one in Drammen and the other in Fredrikstad. The river in Drammen had an increase from around 650 m$^3$/s to around 1550 m$^3$/s from the 15 to 18 September (Fig.~\ref{fig:River}). The volume flux slowly descended before reaching its more normal state in the beginning of November. 

During the cruise the weather was sunny with light or gentle breeze (Fig.~\ref{fig:Wind}). The direction Monday afternoon was from south  and thereafter from east. 

\section{Ocean model}
The FjordOs-model was set up for the time of the pilot cruise. (Link til teknisk rapport for FjordOs-modellen). Current fields at 2 meters depth (\ref{fig:Current1}-\ref{fig:Current4}) reveals a strong outflow from the Drammens fjord during the cruise.

\section{Observations}
Nine drifters were used during the cruise in addition to CTD measurements (Fig.~\ref{fig:Utstyr}). %The ships log were used to estimate the current velocity by finding the difference between speed over ground and speed through water measured at 2.2 meters depth below the keel of the vessel.

\label{fig:Utstyr}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Drifters}
The drifters are made from a drainpipe 1m long, and is equipped with a "donut" approximately 20 cm from the top. The purpose of the donut is to stabilize the drifter, and to decrease vertical motion due to small surface waves. The pipe fills with water when it is dropped into the sea, and is also ballasted for the drifter to stay vertically. The ballast is tuned so that the donut is level with the water surface.

The Arduiono\footnote{https://www.arduino.cc/}-based control unit of the drifters, located at the top of the drifter, is equipped with a GPS-reciever and a GSM-transmitter. The refresh rate of the positions sent to our database was set to 0.0167 Hz (updates once every minute). Unfortunately, some of the drifters failed\footnote{Stopped sending data to our database. This is being looked into by the developer of the drifters.} during the cruise.

The drifters were released in groups of three in two drop zones (Fig.~\ref{fig:ZoneA} and \ref{fig:ZoneB}), and four drifters along a line in a third drop zone(Fig.~\ref{fig:ZoneC}). In addition two individual drifters were released (Fig.~\ref{fig:ZoneD}). For more details see Table~\ref{tab:Drifters}.

\subsection{Trajectory model}
\label{sect:trajmod}
To simulate the trajectories of the drifters, we have applied the open source trajectory-model OpenDrift. This is a trajectory model under development at MET Norway, and is described by its developers as "a software for modeling the trajectories and fate of objects or substances drifting in the ocean, or even in the atmosphere". It is distributed under a GPL v2.0 license, and is available online\footnote{https://github.com/knutfrode/opendrift}.

Three drifters were dropped in zone A approximately at 12:30 pm on 21 September 2015. The drifters were dropped within two meters of each other (Fig.~\ref{fig:DriftereVann}, left).

At the time of deployment the currents were week due to high water (Fig.~\ref{fig:Current2}). The drifters stayed in approximately the same positions during decending tides. At low waters at 07:00 pm the drifters started to float northwards and continued for the next approximately 12 hours. The drifters had a maximum speed of 0.5 m/s which is not found in the simulated current fields (Fig.~\ref{fig:Current2}-\ref{fig:Current3}). The drifters had parted and the drifter closest to the coastline, had a weaker velocity and changed direction first (Fig.~\ref{fig:ZoneA}). 

Two of the drifters were picked up the next day. One drifter was lost.

Three drifters were dropped in zone B approximately at 01:30 pm on 21 September 2015. The drifters were dropped close to each other (Fig.~\ref{fig:DriftereVann}, right).

The ship log revealed that the drifters were deployed close to the eastern edge of the outflow of the Drammens fjord. The drifters followed the outflow from the Drammens fjord southwards before they turned east. The speed of the drifters were approximately 0.5 m/s (Fig.~\ref{fig:ZoneB}) which is approximately the same level as in the simulated current fields (Fig.~\ref{fig:Current1}). 

One of the drifters stopped sending and were substitued at approximately 06:00 pm. The drifters floated further east towards the small island Tofteholmen lying on a south-north threshold. At 10:00 pm the drifters turned westwards. The speed of the drifters increased as they approched the outlet of the Drammens fjord. This is in accordance with the simulated current fields (Fig.~\ref{fig:Current3}). At approximately 09:00 am 22 Sepmteber the drifters were picked up north of the position they were deployed.

Four drifters were released at four positions in a cross-section of the fjord between Horten and Moss on the 22 September 2015. According to the simulated current fields (Fig.~\ref{fig:Current3}) they should have floated southwards with stronger speed the further east. 

The ship log revealed a flow towards south-southwest in the whole cross section at the time of deployment. The currents were weaker towards Horten. At 11:30 a.m. the ship log revealed a weak current towards north close to Horten. All four drifters floated towards southwest, but turned towards northeast after a few hours. The drifter closest to Horten (no. 4), changed direction at approximately 11:30, the two next (no. 5 and 10) at approximately 14:40. The last (no. 7) stopped sending its position shortly after deployment.

Only drifter no. 10 continued to send its position until it was picked up. The drifter stranded in a shallow area outside of the island Karljohansvern by Horten.

One drifter were lost (no. 5), but was found in Hurum a few days later and returned to the research group.

Two single drifters were released in Breiangen (Fig.~\ref{fig:ZoneD}).

One drifter (no. 9) were released in the northeastern part of Breiangen at 16:46 on 22 September 2015. It floated slowly, first to the northeast, then south, and then north before it followed an eastern current along the coast. The simulated current fields reveal a system of unorganized eddies with weak velocities in this area at that time.

One drifter consisting of three interconnected drifters (no. 3/6/7) were released south in the northwestern part of Breiangen at 17:56 on 22 September 2015. It made a anti-clockwise turn with slow velocity an accordance with the simulated current fields (Fig.~\ref{fig:Current3}). At 01:30 the drifter started flowing southwards with the outflow from the Drammens fjord. The velocity of the drifter was almost 0.4m/s east of Lang\o ya which is also in accordance with the simulated current fields (Fig.~\ref{fig:Current4}).

\section{Hydrography}
Episodes of intense precipitation leads to fierce water flow in the rivers, 
like it is observed in Drammen River from September 17 (Fig. 2). % need ref
Such episodes are important for the water quality in the fjord. 
The most obvious effect is that the salinity in the surface layer of the fjord 
are reduced, but the river water also carry suspended particles, organic matter, 
nutrients as well as others substances like for instance contaminants.       

It was taken vertical profiles with a CTD (Conductivity, Temperature and Depth)
from R/V Trygve Braarud 
at stations located along three different transects across the fjord. 
The CTD instrument was of the type Seabird SBE 911 plus.
The stations are listed in Table \ref{tab:CTD} and shown at the map in 
Fig. \ref{fig:CTD_Kart}. 

The profiles of salinity and temperature reveal the different water masses in 
the fjord separated by topography. Fig. \ref{fig:profiles} show profiles from 
four different stations, Fl1 inside the Dr{\o}bak Sill, Im2 in the Dr{\o}bak Sound, 
Pj2 located between Horten and Jel{\o}ya and Sm1 outside Slagen. 
The salinity at station Fl1 show that the water mass below approximately 30 m 
are different than in the rest of the fjord. 
The sill depth at Dr{\o}bak is about 20 m. 
By zooming in on the depth range 90-160 m, it can also be seen that the water 
masses below approximately 115 m in the Dr{\o}bak Sound are different than at 
stations further out in the fjord. The sill depth between the Dr{\o}bak Sond and 
Breiangen is about 115 m.

At the CTD instrument, other sensors can be installed. 
On board R/V Trygve Braarud it is a Seabird SBE plus 9 CTD, 
with additional sensors for measuring oxygen concentration, turbidity, 
chlorophyll fluorescence and coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM). 
All of these, except the oxygen sensor, are optical instruments. 
The turbidity is a measure of much light is scattered in the water, 
which depends on particle concentration. The value of the unit FNU is 
approximately equal to a particle concertation of 1 mg/L, 
but the scattering can also be affected by other things than particles, 
like water bobbles. Chlorophyll fluorescence is a measure of the amount 
of fluorescent light from algae, and is a proxy for the chlorophyll content 
in the water mass. However, the relation between chlorophyll fluorescence 
and actual chlorophyll concentration can vary considerably, 
for instance with depth. 
CDOM is also called yellow substance, and is the optically measurable 
component of the dissolved organic matter in water. 
There is usually a strong negative correlation between salinity and CDOM, 
since the rivers are the major source of organic matter to the coastal zone. 

During the cruise with R/V Trygve Braarud (Sep 21th – 23rd), three transects 
across the fjord was conducted with the CTD. Nine stations (Me1-Mm1) were taken 
across Breiangen from Lang{\o}ya in the west to Jel{\o}ya in the east. 
Five stations (Pi1-Pl1) were taken between Horten and Gullholmen. 
Four stations (Sk1-Sn1) were taken between Slagen and Edge{\o}ya. 
For each of the transect salinity, temperature, chlorophyll fluorescence, 
CDOM and oxygen saturation are shown (Figs. \ref{fig.brei1} – \ref{fig.salgen}). 
Two features are striking, 
firstly the strong input of fresh water from Drammen river and secondly the algae 
bloom on the east side of the fjord.

In Breiangen the first day of the cruise the freshest water is found on the west 
side, and on the east side the salinity is relatively high and high fluorescence 
values are found at the station closest to Jel{\o}ya. 
Two days later the fresh water is more evenly distributed across Breiangen, 
except at stations Mj1 and Mk1. At these two stations the highest fluorescence 
in the surface layer values are found. It is very clear that the algae are not 
found in the freshest part of the river water, since the low salinity is less 
optimal for marine algae. The algae are nevertheless found close to the surface 
where more light is available, and where the water column are more stratified. 
It is clear that the CDOM and the salinity pattern are very similar, and that 
CDOM is a good indicator for river water. It can also be noted that high oxygen 
concentrations can be related to high concentration of algae. 

Much of the same patter as is seen in Breiangen, is found in the transect 
between Horten and Gullholmen. The water from the Drammen River is found in 
the western part, and an algae bloom is found at the station farthest to the east. 
At the transect between Slagen and Edge{\o}ya the picture is more diffuse, with both 
the freshest and the most fluorescence rich water is found to the east. 
The salinity in this area can just as well be influenced by water from Glomma, 
given the right atmospheric conditions, but we will here explain that the low 
salinity at this transect is cause by water from Drammenelva. 
First a mixing diagram can be shown, where two water properties are plotted 
along each of the axes. Often temperature and salinity is chosen, 
but here we will use CDOM and chlorophyll fluorescence. 
If the low salinity at station Sm1 and Sn1 at 1.5 m is due to river water from 
Drammenselva, this water mass are a mixture water with high CDOM and low 
fluorescence values and water with low CDOM and high fluorescence values. 
River water meets marine water with algae. 
The points D1 and D2 (Figs. \ref{fig.brei1} and \ref{fig.brei1}) are chosen to 
represent the river water, 
and the points B1 and B2 are chosen to represent the marine water. 
From the mixture diagram (Fig. \ref{fig:CFdiagram}) it can be seen that it is 
plausible that the water masses at station Sm1 and Sn1 
(called S1 and S2 in Fig. \ref{fig.salgen}) indeed are a 
product of river water and marine water with algae. 
From the model results shows that it should be expected that the river 
water from Drammenselva is found at the east side of the Slagen transect.
