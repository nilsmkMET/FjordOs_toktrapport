\section{Introduction}
Provided is a documentation of a scientific cruise in the Oslofjord from the 21st to 23rd of September 2015. The cruise was a pilot study to investigate if targeted observations would benefit the validation of the new Oslofjord model (ref. teknisk rapport), and was carried out as part of the FjordOs project.


Nine drifters were used during the cruise in addition to CTD measurements (Figure~\ref{fig:Utstyr}). The drifters were dropped in four different zones. CTD measurements were taken along three different transects across the fjord. %The ships log were used to estimate the current velocity by finding the difference between speed over ground and speed through water measured at 2.2 meters depth below the keel of the vessel.

\subsection{Weather conditions}

The storm "Petra" hit Buskerud, Vestfold, Telemark, and Agder from Monday 14th to Friday 18th of September 2015. The storm was caused by a main low pressure in the English channel which moved northwards crossing the North Sea. The low pressure caused an increased water level in the Oslofjord from the 17th to 18th of September before the water level was normalized around the 20th of September (Figure~\ref{fig:Waterlevel}).

Due to the heavy rainfall that followed, rivers and streams were flooded and caused an increased fresh water flow into the fjord. There are two large rivers connected with the Oslofjord, one in Drammen and the other in Fredrikstad. The river in Drammen had an increase from around 650 m$^3$/s to around 1550 m$^3$/s from the 15th to 18th of September (Figure~\ref{fig:River}). The volume flux slowly decreased before reaching its normal state in the beginning of November. 

During the cruise, the weather was sunny with light or gentle breeze (Figure~\ref{fig:Wind}). The wind direction Monday afternoon was southerly, turning east. 

\subsection{Ocean model}
The FjordOs-model was set up for the time of the cruise. (FIX!! Link til teknisk rapport for FjordOs-modellen). Current fields at 2 meters depth (Figure~\ref{fig:Current1} - \ref{fig:Current4}) reveal a strong outflow from the Drammens fjord during the cruise. When comparing this to the sea surface salinity (SSS) i Figure~\ref{fig:Salinity1}, we conclude that this strong current is indeed a result of the increased freshwater discharge from the Drammen river.

\section{Observations}


\subsection{Drifter trajectories}
The drifters that was used during the cruise (see Figure~\ref{fig:Utstyr}) are prototype low-cost units produced by a norwegian startup. They are made from a plastic drainpipe 1m long, and is equipped with a foam "donut" approximately 20 cm from the top. The purpose of the donut is to stabilize the drifter, and to decrease vertical motion due to small surface waves. The pipe is filled with water when it is dropped into the sea, and is  ballasted for the drifter to stay vertically. The ballast is tuned so that the donut is level with the water surface.

The Arduiono\footnote{https://www.arduino.cc/}-based control unit of the drifters, located at the top of the drifter, is equipped with a GPS-reciever and a GSM-transmitter. The refresh rate of the positions sent to our database was set to 0.0167 Hz (updates once every minute). Unfortunately, some of the drifters failed\footnote{Stopped sending data to our database. This has been fixed by the developer of the drifters.} during the cruise.

The drifters were released in groups of three in two drop zones (Figure~\ref{fig:ZoneA} and \ref{fig:ZoneB}), and four drifters along a line in a third drop zone (Figure~\ref{fig:ZoneC}). In addition two individual drifters were released (Figure~\ref{fig:ZoneD}). For more details see Table~\ref{tab:Drifters}.

Three drifters were dropped in zone A approximately at 12:30 local time (LT is UTC+1) on 21st of September 2015. The drifters were dropped within two meters of each other (Figure~\ref{fig:DriftereVann}, left).

At the time of deployment, the currents were weak due to high water (Figure~\ref{fig:Current2}). The drifters stayed in approximately the same positions during ebb tide. At low water around 19:00LT, the drifters started to drift northwards and continued for the next 12 hours. The drifters had a maximum speed of 0.5 m/s.% Similar speeds is not found in the simulated current fields (Figure~\ref{fig:Current2}-\ref{fig:Current3}). 
The drifters had parted and the drifter closest to the coastline, had a weaker velocity and changed direction first (Figure~\ref{fig:ZoneA}). 

Two of the drifters were picked up the next day. One drifter stranded and was lost.

Three drifters were dropped in zone B approximately at 13:30LT on 21st of September 2015. The drifters were dropped close to each other (Figure~\ref{fig:DriftereVann}, right).

Since there was little or no wind at the time of the deployment, we can give a crude estimate of the currents by estimating the ship drift. This is done by comparing the ship speed and course according to the GPS (Speed Over Ground, SOG, and Course Over Ground, COG) with speed through the water and compass heading. The difference between these two vectors give a estimate of the currents, which revealed that the drifters were deployed close to the eastern edge of the outflow of the Drammensfjord. The drifters followed the outflow from the Drammens fjord southwards before they turned east. The speed of the drifters were approximately 0.5 m/s (Figure~\ref{fig:ZoneB}). % which is approximately the same level as in the simulated current fields (Figure~\ref{fig:Current1}). 

One of the drifters stopped sending and was replaced by a working unit at approximately 18:00LT. The drifters driftes further east towards the small island Tofteholmen lying on a south-north threshold. At 22:00LT the drifters turned westwards. The speed of the drifters increased as they approched the outlet of the Drammensfjord.% This is in accordance with the simulated current fields (Figure~\ref{fig:Current3}). 
At approximately 09:00LT on the 22nd of September, the drifters were picked up north of the position they were deployed.

Four drifters were released at four positions in a cross-section of the fjord between Horten and Moss on September 22nd 2015.% According to the simulated current fields (Figure~\ref{fig:Current3}) they should have floated southwards with stronger speed the further east. 

When estimating the ship drift, using the same method as described in Section \ref{sect:ZoneB}, this indicated a flow towards south-southwest in the whole cross section at the time of deployment. The currents were weakest on the western side of the cross-section, towards Horten. At 11:30LT, in a position close to Horten, the ship drift revealed a weak current towards north close to Horten. All four drifters floated towards southwest, but turned towards northeast after a few hours. The drifter closest to Horten (no. 4), changed direction at approximately 11:30LT, and the two further east (no. 5 and 10) at approximately 14:40LT. The drifter furthest east (no. 7) stopped sending its position shortly after deployment, and was picked up to the southwest of its initial position 3.5 hours after deployment.

Only drifter no. 10 continued to send its position until it was picked up. The drifter stranded in a shallow area just east of the island Veal{\o}s north of Horten.

One drifter were lost (no. 5), but was found in Hurum a few days later and returned to the research group.

Two single drifters were released in Breiangen (Figure~\ref{fig:ZoneD}).

One drifter (no. 9) was released in the northeastern part of Breiangen at 16:46LT on 22nd of September 2015. It drifted slowly towards the northeast, then south, and then north before it followed an eastern current along the coast. %The simulated current fields reveal a system of unorganized eddies with weak velocities in this area at that time.

One drifter (no. 6) was released south in the northwestern part of Breiangen at 17:56LT on 22nd of September 2015. It first made a anti-clockwise turn with low drifting velocities. % an accordance with the simulated current fields (Figure~\ref{fig:Current3}). 
At 01:30LT the drifter started going southwards with the outflow from the Drammensfjord. The velocity of the drifter was almost 0.4m/s east of Lang{\o} ya. % which is also in accordance with the simulated current fields (Figure~\ref{fig:Current4}).

\subsection{Hydrography}
Episodes of intense precipitation leads to fierce water flow in the rivers, 
like it is observed in Drammen River from September 17 (Figure~\ref{fig:River}).
Such episodes are important for the water quality in the fjord. 
The most obvious effect is that the salinity in the surface layer of the fjord 
are reduced, but the river water also carry suspended particles, organic matter, 
nutrients as well as others substances like for instance contaminants.       

It was taken vertical profiles with a CTD (Conductivity, Temperature and Depth)
from R/V Trygve Braarud 
at stations located along three different transects across the fjord. 
The CTD instrument was of the type Seabird SBE 911 plus.
The stations are listed in Table \ref{tab:CTD} and shown at the map in 
Figure~\ref{fig:CTD_Kart}. 

The profiles of salinity and temperature reveal the different water masses in 
the fjord separated by topography. Figure~\ref{fig:profiles} show profiles from 
four different stations, Fl1 inside the Dr{\o}bak Sill, Im2 in the Dr{\o}bak Sound, 
Pj2 located between Horten and Jel{\o}ya and Sm1 outside Slagen. 
The salinity at station Fl1 show that the water mass below approximately 30 m 
are different than in the rest of the fjord. 
The sill depth at Dr{\o}bak is about 20 m. 
By zooming in on the depth range 90-160 m, it can also be seen that the water 
masses below approximately 115 m in the Dr{\o}bak Sound are different than at 
stations further out in the fjord. The sill depth between the Dr{\o}bak Sond and 
Breiangen is about 115 m.

At the CTD instrument, other sensors can be installed. 
On board R/V Trygve Braarud it is a Seabird SBE plus 9 CTD, 
with additional sensors for measuring oxygen concentration, turbidity, 
chlorophyll fluorescence and coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM). 
All of these, except the oxygen sensor, are optical instruments. 
The turbidity is a measure of much light is scattered in the water, 
which depends on particle concentration. The value of the unit FNU is 
approximately equal to a particle concertation of 1 mg/L, 
but the scattering can also be affected by other things than particles, 
like water bobbles. Chlorophyll fluorescence is a measure of the amount 
of fluorescent light from algae, and is a proxy for the chlorophyll content 
in the water mass. However, the relation between chlorophyll fluorescence 
and actual chlorophyll concentration can vary considerably, 
for instance with depth. 
CDOM is also called yellow substance, and is the optically measurable 
component of the dissolved organic matter in water. 
There is usually a strong negative correlation between salinity and CDOM, 
since the rivers are the major source of organic matter to the coastal zone. 

During the cruise with R/V Trygve Braarud (Sep 21th – 23rd), three transects 
across the fjord was conducted with the CTD. Nine stations (Me1-Mm1) were taken 
across Breiangen from Lang{\o}ya in the west to Jel{\o}ya in the east. 
Five stations (Pi1-Pl1) were taken between Horten and Gullholmen. 
Four stations (Sk1-Sn1) were taken between Slagen and Edge{\o}ya. 
For each of the transect salinity, temperature, chlorophyll fluorescence, 
CDOM and oxygen saturation are shown (Figs. \ref{fig:brei1} and \ref{fig:slagen}). 
Two features are striking, 
firstly the strong input of fresh water from Drammen river and secondly the algae bloom on the east side of the fjord.

In Breiangen the first day of the cruise the freshest water is found on the west 
side, and on the east side the salinity is relatively high and high fluorescence 
values are found at the station closest to Jel{\o}ya. 
Two days later the fresh water is more evenly distributed across Breiangen, 
except at stations Mj1 and Mk1. At these two stations the highest fluorescence 
in the surface layer values are found. It is very clear that the algae are not 
found in the freshest part of the river water, since the low salinity is less 
optimal for marine algae. The algae are nevertheless found close to the surface 
where more light is available, and where the water column are more stratified. 
It is clear that the CDOM and the salinity pattern are very similar, and that 
CDOM is a good indicator for river water. It can also be noted that high oxygen 
concentrations can be related to high concentration of algae. 

Much of the same patter as is seen in Breiangen, is found in the transect 
between Horten and Gullholmen. The water from the Drammen River is found in 
the western part, and an algae bloom is found at the station farthest to the east. 
At the transect between Slagen and Edge{\o}ya the picture is more diffuse, with both 
the freshest and the most fluorescence rich water is found to the east. 
The salinity in this area can just as well be influenced by water from Glomma, 
given the right atmospheric conditions, but we will here explain that the low 
salinity at this transect is cause by water from Drammenelva. 
First a mixing diagram can be shown, where two water properties are plotted 
along each of the axes. Often temperature and salinity is chosen, 
but here we will use CDOM and chlorophyll fluorescence. 
If the low salinity at station Sm1 and Sn1 at 1.5 m is due to river water from 
Drammenselva, this water mass are a mixture water with high CDOM and low 
fluorescence values and water with low CDOM and high fluorescence values. 
River water meets marine water with algae. 
The points D1 and D2 (Figs. \ref{fig:brei1} and \ref{fig:brei2}) are chosen to 
represent the river water, 
and the points B1 and B2 are chosen to represent the marine water. 
From the mixture diagram (Figure~\ref{fig:CFdiagram}) it can be seen that it is 
plausible that the water masses at station Sm1 and Sn1 
(called S1 and S2 in Figure~\ref{fig:slagen}) indeed are a 
product of river water and marine water with algae. 
From the model results shows that it should be expected that the river 
water from Drammenselva is found at the east side of the Slagen transect.

\section{Simulations}

\subsection{Trajectories}
\label{sect:trajmod}
To simulate the trajectories of the drifters, we have applied the open source trajectory-model OpenDrift. This is a trajectory model under development at MET Norway, and is described by its developers as "a software for modeling the trajectories and fate of objects or substances drifting in the ocean, or even in the atmosphere". It is distributed under a GPL v2.0 license, and is available on GitHub\footnote{https://github.com/knutfrode/opendrift}.

The OpenDrift model was forced with currents from the FjordOs model and with wind from the Arome-MetCoOp 2.5km (Arome2.5) atmospheric model (the same atmospheric model was as used as forcing when running the FjordOs hindcast). We also performed OpenDrift-simulations using currents from the NorKyst-800m model together wind from Arome2.5, which is the current operational setup for running trajectories at MET Norway, to compare with the new FjordOs model. We can tune a number of parameters when running OpenDrift, e.g. random walk and the winddrift factor. Random walk was not used in our simulations, but variations in winddrift factor was applied. At each of the locations of the real drifters, we released six "virtual" drifters, from 2.5 hours before to 2.5 hours after the real drifters. This was done to see if the time of the release was an important factor. The resulting trajectories can be viewed in Figure~\ref{fig:opendrift1} - \ref{fig:opendrift4}.

\subsection{Hydrography}

In this chapter we will compare how the salinity vary across the fjord in three 
transects, based on observations and based on model results.
CTD casts was taken at nine stations across Breiangen at two occations as described earlier.
The first transect was taken Sep 21 and the second two days later 
(Figs. \ref{fig:CTD_Mod_M1} and \ref{fig:CTD_Mod_M2}, upper panels).
At the first occation the river water from Drammen river is concentrated on the 
west side of the transect.
Two days later, the river water is more evenly distributed across Breiangen.
The model reflects this well
(Fig. \ref{fig:CTD_Mod_M1} and \ref{fig:CTD_Mod_M2}, lower panels).
The most striking difference between the observations and the model results,
are the too high salinity below the pycnocline in the model results (5-10 psu).
This could most probably be tracked to the open boundary conditions.
This feature is seen in all the four transects shown here.

The transect between Horten and Moss was taken Sep 22 (Fig. \ref{fig:CTD_Mod_P}).

The freshest surface water was found at the west side of this transect, just as in Breiangen.
This was the case both in the observations and in the model results.
The stratification was somehat weaker in the middle of the fjord.
This can be seen by studying the salinity at 6 m depth, thas has a minimum value in the 
middle of the fjord, both in the observations and in the model results.

The transect between Slagen and Eld{\o}ya was taken Sep 22 (Fig. \ref{fig:CTD_Mod_S}).
In the observations the lowest surface salinity is found on the east side of the fjord,
in contrast to the other transects further north.
As shown earlier this fresh water mass has its origin in the Drammen river.
This feature is not reflected in the model results at the same time.
As we will see later, this discrepancy could be due to wrong timing, and that the freshest 
water could be found at the east side of the transect, also in the model, at a later stage.

\section{Discussion \& Conclusions}

The main objective of this scientific cruise was to assess wether we could make use of targeted observations in the development and validation of the new FjordOs model covering the Oslofjord.

The main focus area for the obeservations was the Breiangen area, located approximately in the middle of the fjord in the north-south direction. This is one of the widest areas of the fjord, except for the entrance itself, and is also very interesting because of the Drammensfjord and Drammen river, with has a large freshwater flux that empties into the Breiangen area. Our cruise took place just after the heavy rain of the storm "Petra", and the impact of this increased freshwater flux was clearly visible in many of our measurements.

Introducing winddrift in the trajectories of the drfiters is crucial to explain, and simulate, the observed drift. The best fit between simulations and observations, was given by setting the winddrift factor to 1\% (the expected influence of wind was between 0 and 3\%). When we compare the trajectories of the drifters from our simulations to the ones that was observed, we can see that there is a very good agreement in parts of the domain. Especially the drifters in Dropzone A and C (Figure \ref{fig:ZoneA} and \ref{fig:ZoneC}), and the single drops in Figure \ref{fig:ZoneD} showed a good compariosn between observations and simulations. The drifters that was dropped near the mouth of the Drammensfjord (Dropzone B, Figure \ref{fig:ZoneB}) did not compare as good. This could be connected to errors in hydrography, and that the water coming out of the Drammensfjord dit not spread out enough, but continued south across the Breiangen as a too narrow jet. The comparison of observed and modelled salinities in Figure \ref{fig:brei1} suggest that the freshwater layer on top of the watercolumn is too shallow, which in turn could produce currents that are too surface intensified. It could also relate to wrong timing of the freshwater release from the Drammens fjord. 
Seems like there was too much influence from the Drammen river on the drifter trajectories. 
The FjordOs-model provided, in general, better drifter trajectories than the operational NorKyst-800m model.

The errors in hydrography are likely to be related to errors in the initial conditions of the model, that comes from NorKyst-800m.

The number of observatiosn in the Oslofjord is very sparse, and when we consider the scales of the physical phenomenons we try to resolve with the FjordOs-model, we can clearly see the need for targeted observations to validate and imporve the model. It is important to have enough observations (both temporal and spatial) to give an estimate of the mean physical state of the fjord, both with regards to hydrography and currents. In addition, targeted observations in relation to e.g. special weather events, have proven to be very useful to study specific situations.
